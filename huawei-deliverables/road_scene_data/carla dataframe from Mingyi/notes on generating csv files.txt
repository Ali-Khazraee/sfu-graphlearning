According to Mingyi, Graph_carla_to_Data 1.ipynb reads from a pickle file that was extracted from scene2vec and creates raw csv files.

I tried to run it but I got this error: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'roadscene2vec'"

Mingyi told me: "There are several pre-request for the pkl file. It is a bit complicated.The problem for this "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'roadscene2vec'", is that you need the roadscene2vec installed on your environment. So I sent you the file which is extracted from the pickle file"

I have attached the "raw data" in the same directory as this text but I never used it. I do not know how he generated the csv files. He told me that "I have problem to find the code which generate the df_edge_car.csv. The idea of generation of df_edge_car.csv is simple. It is the part of the df_nodes.csv, which selects the necessary columns to store"
